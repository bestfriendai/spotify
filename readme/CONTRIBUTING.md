## Reporting a Bug

1. Ensure you've replicated the issue against `main`. There is a chance the issue may have already been fixed.
2. Search for any similar [issues](https://github.com/njm222/tessellator/issues/) (both opened and closed). There is a chance someone may have reported it already.
3. If no existing issue is found, add a new issue
   - Provide a screen recording. Sometimes this is not a possibility, in which case provide a detailed description along with any code snippets that would help in triaging the issue.
